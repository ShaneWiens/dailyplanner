# Dailyplanner 

Using a prebuilt(mostly) HTML page, and provided CSS file. The task was to program events that triggered functions and displayed tasks during the standard work hours. 

# What I did

First step, as I'm learning to do with all tasks (ha tasks) is make variables for the obvious elements I need to access.
Then I built the function to create the hourcard elements
Then I wanted the forms used to be able to be saved to local storage
Finally I wanted to be able to load those tasks for display upon returning to the page

# What I learned

I learned I am MUCH more comfortable writing vanilla javascript.
I'll be putting in some jquery hours this coming week. 
I also learned how amazing my group is, having people around to bounce ideas off of, see their code, and have them troubleshoot my own. Priceless, but that's kind of what folks have been hinting at.
